# Landing-Page-Sample-Project
This project is a beginner-level website layout named "Guarder", designed as a security service landing page. It was one of my early projects, which is why the textual content is filled with placeholder Lorem Ipsum text. The project demonstrates my understanding of HTML5 structure and the use of external CSS for styling. It includes a fully designed homepage with multiple sections such as a navigation bar, hero section, services overview, about us, contact form, and a team section featuring guard profiles. The layout uses semantic HTML elements, Font Awesome icons, form elements, grid structures, buttons, and a responsive container setup. The purpose of this project was to practice how to organize a full web page layout, manage external styling, and apply basic visual hierarchy and sectioning in web development.
